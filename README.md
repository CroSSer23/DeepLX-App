   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser or serve it using a local web server:

   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

1. Click the **Settings** button (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Enter your custom API endpoint URL
3. The setting will be saved automatically in your browser's local storage

### Auto-translate Settings
